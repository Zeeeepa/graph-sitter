# Codegen SDK Integration with Autogenlib Implementation Research

## Overview

This research provides comprehensive analysis and implementation design for integrating the Codegen SDK with autogenlib as a sub-module that can be effectively called by the contexten orchestrator/system-watcher.

## Research Objective

Design the most effective implementation for Codegen SDK integration with autogenlib that:
- Integrates seamlessly with existing graph-sitter codebase analysis functions
- Provides optimal performance with <2s response time targets
- Supports both event-driven and direct API call patterns
- Implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Maintains architectural consistency with existing contexten extension system
