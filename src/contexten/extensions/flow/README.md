## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from contexten.extensions.flow import FlowManager, FlowOrchestrator

# Initialize flow manager
flow_manager = FlowManager(
    agents=your_agents,
    enable_prefect=True,
    enable_controlflow=True
)

# Create and execute a simple flow
result = await flow_manager.create_flow(
    name="example_flow",
    workflow_def={
        "stages": [
            {
                "name": "data_processing",
                "tasks": [
                    {
                        "name": "fetch_data",
                        "required_tools": ["http_client"]
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "process_data", 
                        "required_tools": ["data_processor"]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
)

# Execute the flow
execution_result = await flow_manager.execute_flow(result["flow_id"])
```

### Advanced Orchestration

```python
from contexten.extensions.flow import (
    FlowOrchestrator, 
    FlowPriority, 
    SchedulingStrategy
)

# Initialize orchestrator with advanced features
orchestrator = FlowOrchestrator(
    agents=your_agents,
    max_concurrent_flows=5,
    enable_monitoring=True
)

await orchestrator.start()

# Submit high-priority flow
result = await orchestrator.submit_flow(
    name="critical_task",
    workflow_def=workflow_definition,
    priority=FlowPriority.HIGH,
    framework="controlflow"
)

# Execute synchronously with timeout
sync_result = await orchestrator.execute_flow_sync(
    name="quick_task",
    workflow_def=simple_workflow,
    timeout=60.0
)
```

## Integration with Contexten

The flow extension integrates seamlessly with the Contexten ecosystem:

### ContextenApp Integration
```python
from contexten import ContextenApp

app = ContextenApp(name="my-app")

# Flow manager is automatically available
flow_result = await app.flow_manager.create_flow(
    name="automated_task",
    workflow_def=workflow_definition
)
```

### Dashboard Integration
The flow system provides APIs for dashboard integration:
- Real-time flow status updates
- Performance metrics and analytics
- Flow creation and management interfaces
- Resource usage monitoring

### Event Integration
Flows can be triggered by various events:
- GitHub webhook events
- Linear issue updates
- Slack commands
- Scheduled triggers

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Design
- Keep stages focused and cohesive
- Use appropriate execution modes (sequential vs parallel)
- Define clear dependencies between flows
- Set realistic deadlines and priorities

### 2. Resource Management
- Monitor system load and adjust concurrency limits
- Use resource-aware scheduling for heavy workloads
- Implement proper cleanup in custom agents
- Consider agent capacity when designing workflows

### 3. Error Handling
- Enable automatic retry for transient failures
- Implement custom recovery strategies for specific error types
- Use appropriate timeout values
- Log detailed error information for debugging

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Use load balancing for distributed workloads
- Monitor execution metrics and optimize bottlenecks
- Cache frequently used resources
- Implement efficient agent selection algorithms

## Framework-Specific Features

### ControlFlow Integration
- Advanced orchestration patterns
- Complex workflow dependencies
- Agent coordination and communication
- Distributed execution capabilities

### Prefect Integration
- Professional workflow monitoring
- Detailed execution logs and metrics
- Flow versioning and deployment
- Integration with Prefect Cloud/Server

### Strands Integration
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- Tool registry and management
- Event-driven execution
- Context-aware agent behavior

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Flow not executing:**
- Check agent availability and capacity
- Verify workflow definition format
- Ensure dependencies are satisfied
- Check system resource usage

**High failure rate:**
- Review error logs and recovery strategies
- Adjust retry settings and timeouts
- Verify agent tool compatibility
- Check network connectivity

**Poor performance:**
- Monitor system load and adjust concurrency
- Optimize workflow design and task granularity
- Use appropriate scheduling strategy
- Consider agent distribution and load balancing

### Debug Mode
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('contexten.extensions.flow').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Health Checks
```python
# Check orchestrator health
status = await orchestrator.get_orchestrator_status()
if status['status'] != 'running':
    await orchestrator.start()

# Check scheduler health  
scheduler_status = scheduler.get_scheduler_status()
if not scheduler_status['running']:
    await scheduler.start()
```
