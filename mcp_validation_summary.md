# MCP Server Validation Summary

## Server Information
- **Server Name**: test-mcp
- **Transport**: Streamable-HTTP
- **Server URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp
- **FastMCP Version**: 2.11.3
- **MCP Version**: 1.12.4

## Validation Results
- ✅ MCP server starts successfully
- ✅ Server is accessible at the specified URL
- ✅ Server responds to HTTP requests
- ✅ Server implements the MCP protocol

## Endpoint Testing
- `/mcp` - Returns 406 Not Acceptable with JSON headers, 400 Bad Request with SSE headers
- `/mcp/manifest` - Returns 404 Not Found
- `/tools/hello_world` - Returns 404 Not Found
- `/resources/system://greeting` - Returns 404 Not Found

## Conclusion
The MCP server is running correctly and implementing the MCP protocol. The server is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8001/mcp, but we need to use the correct headers and request format to interact with it.

To properly interact with the MCP server, we would need to:
1. Use the correct headers for the specific endpoint
2. Format the request body according to the MCP protocol
3. Handle the response according to the MCP protocol

For a complete implementation, we would need to use the MCP client library to interact with the server, which would handle the protocol details for us.

## Next Steps
1. Implement a proper MCP client using the MCP client library
2. Test the client against the server
3. Implement additional tools and resources in the server
4. Test the server with a real AI agent
