  <Accordion title="What languages does Graph-sitter support?" icon="code">
    Graph-sitter currently parses two languages:
    - [Python](/api-reference/python)
    - [TypeScript](/api-reference/typescript)

    We're actively working on expanding language support based on community needs.
    <Tip>
      Learn more about how Graph-sitter handles language specifics in the [Language
      Support](/building-with-graph-sitter/language-support) guide.

    <Accordion title="Is Graph-sitter exact?" icon="scale-balanced">
    Pretty much! Graph-sitter is roughly on par with `mypy` and `tsc`. There are always edge cases in static analysis that are provably impossible to get (for example doing `eval()` on a string), but all of Codegen's APIs are intended to be exact unless otherwise specified. Please reach out if you find an edge case and we will do our best to patch it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is Graph-sitter suitable for large codebases?" icon="database">
    Yes! Graph-sitter was developed on multmillion-line Python and Typescript codebases
    and includes optimizations for handling large-scale transformations.

  <Accordion title="Can I use Graph-sitter with my existing tools?" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    Yes - [by design](/introduction/guiding-principles#python-first-composability). 
    
    Graph-sitter works like any other python package. It works alongside your IDE, version control system, and other development tools.
