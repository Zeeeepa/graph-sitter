Graph-sitter performs advanced static analysis to build a rich graph representation of your codebase. This pre-computation step analyzes dependencies, references, types, and control flow to enable fast and reliable code manipulation operations.

<Note>
  Graph-sitter is built on top of
  [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and
  [rustworkx](https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx) and has implemented most
  language server features from scratch.
</Note>
<Info>
  Graph-sitter is open source. Check out the [source
  code](https://github.com/codegen-sh/graph-sitter) to learn more!

## The Codebase Graph

At the heart of Graph-sitter is a comprehensive graph representation of your code. When you initialize a [Codebase](/api-reference/core/Codebase), it performs static analysis to construct a rich graph structure connecting code elements:

```python
# Initialize and analyze the codebase
from graph_sitter import Codebase
codebase = Codebase("./")

# Access pre-computed relationships
function = codebase.get_symbol("process_data")
print(f"Dependencies: {function.dependencies}")  # Instant lookup
print(f"Usages: {function.usages}")  # No parsing needed
```

### Building the Graph

Codegen's graph construction happens in two stages:

1. **AST Parsing**: We use [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) as our foundation for parsing code into Abstract Syntax Trees. Tree-sitter provides fast, reliable parsing across multiple languages.

2. **Multi-file Graph Construction**: Custom parsing logic, implemented in [rustworkx](https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx) and Python, analyzes these ASTs to construct a more sophisticated graph structure. This graph captures relationships between [symbols](/building-with-graph-sitter/symbol-api), [files](/building-with-graph-sitter/files-and-directories), [imports](/building-with-graph-sitter/imports), and more.

### Performance Through Pre-computation

Pre-computing a rich index enables Graph-sitter to make certain operations very fast that that are relevant to refactors and code analysis:

- Finding all usages of a symbol
- Detecting circular dependencies
- Analyzing the dependency graphs
- Tracing call graphs
- Static analysis-based code retrieval for RAG
- ...etc.

<Tip>
  Pre-parsing the codebase enables constant-time lookups rather than requiring
  re-parsing or real-time analysis.
</Tip>

## Multi-Language Support

One of Codegen's core principles is that many programming tasks are fundamentally similar across languages.

Currently, Graph-sitter supports:

- [Python](/api-reference/python)
- [TypeScript](/api-reference/typescript)
- [React & JSX](/building-with-graph-sitter/react-and-jsx)

<Note>
  Learn about how Graph-sitter handles language specifics in the [Language
  Support](/building-with-graph-sitter/language-support) guide.
</Note>

We've started with these ecosystems but designed our architecture to be extensible. The graph-based approach provides a consistent interface across languages while handling language-specific details under the hood.

## Build with Us

Graph-sitter is just getting started, and we're excited about the possibilities ahead. We enthusiastically welcome contributions from the community, whether it's:

- Adding support for new languages
- Implementing new analysis capabilities
- Improving performance
- Expanding the API
- Adding new transformations
- Improving documentation
