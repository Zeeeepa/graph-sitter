## Our Mission

Our mission is to build fully-autonomous software engineering.

We believe the most effective path towards this goal is through intelligent AI agents that seamlessly integrate into existing developer workflows.

Our agents connect with tools developers use every day, like GitHub, Slack, and Linear, to automate tasks ranging from fixing bugs and implementing features to writing tests and improving documentation.

By handling routine development tasks, Codegen empowers engineers to focus on higher-level challenges and accelerates the entire software development lifecycle.

## The Team

Based in San Francisco, we're a team of engineers and researchers passionate about:

- Making large-scale code changes more accessible
- Building tools that work the way developers think
- Creating the infrastructure for AI-powered code manipulation
- Advancing the state of the art in program transformation

## Open Source

We believe in the power of open source software. Our core library, [codegen](https://github.com/codegen-sh/graph-sitter), is freely available and open to contributions from the community.
