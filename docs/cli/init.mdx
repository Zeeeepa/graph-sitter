The `init` command sets up Codegen in your repository, creating necessary configuration files and pulling documentation locally.

## Usage

```bash
gs init [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

- `--repo-name`: The name of the repository (defaults to current git repo name)
- `--organization-name`: The name of the organization (defaults to git organization)

## Directory Structure

When you run `init`, gs creates a `.codegen` directory in your repository with the following structure:

```
.codegen/
├── config.toml         # Configuration file with repo and org info
├── codemods/          # Your codemods live here
│   └── my_codemod.py  # Created via `gs create my-codemod`
├── docs/              # Local documentation for offline access
│   ├── api/
│   ├── examples/
│   └── tutorials/
└── prompts/           # Generated system prompts for AI assistance
```

<Note>
  Only `config.toml` and the `codemods/` directory are tracked in Git. The rest
  of the `.codegen` directory is automatically added to your `.gitignore`.
</Note>

This setup allows you to:

- Track and version your codemods with your repository
- Use `codebase.reset()` without losing progress on your codemod implementation
- Share codemods with your team through version control

## Recommended Structure

We recommend keeping your Codegen codemods in the `.codegen/codemods/` directory (this is the default when using `gs create`). This:

- Keeps transformation code separate from your application code
- Makes it easy to find and manage all your codemods
- Ensures consistent behavior with `codebase.reset()`

## Local Documentation

Codegen pulls documentation and examples locally to:

- Provide offline access to guides and references
- Enable AI to give contextual help about your codebase
- Allow searching through examples and tutorials

## Requirements

The command must be run from within a git repository. If you're not in one, you'll need to:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
gs init
```

## Examples

Initialize with default settings (uses git repo info):

```bash
gs init
```

Initialize with custom organization and repo:

```bash
gs init --organization-name "my-org" --repo-name "my-project"
```

## Next Steps

After initializing:

1. Create your first codemod:

```bash
gs create my-function . -d "describe what you want to do"
```

Note: The second parameter (`.`) specifies the path where the codemod should be created. This is required.

2. Run it:

```bash
gs run my-function --apply-local
```

## Updating

You can run `init` again to update your local documentation and configuration:

```bash
gs init
```

This will refresh the `.codegen` directory while preserving your existing configuration.
