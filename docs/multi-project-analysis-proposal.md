## Analysis Prompting Strategy for Multi-Project Environments

### 1. Context-Aware Analysis Prompts

#### Project Context Injection
```
Analyze the following projects with their specific contexts:
- Project A: [Type: Web Application, Tech Stack: React/Node.js, Team Size: 5, Priority: High]
- Project B: [Type: API Service, Tech Stack: Python/FastAPI, Team Size: 3, Priority: Medium]
- Project C: [Type: Data Pipeline, Tech Stack: Python/Airflow, Team Size: 2, Priority: Low]

Focus on: [Specific analysis type - security, performance, code quality, etc.]
Consider: [Cross-project dependencies, shared resources, team coordination]
```

#### Requirement-Driven Analysis
```
Given the following requirements across multiple projects:
- Requirement R1: Implement OAuth2 authentication (Projects A, B)
- Requirement R2: Add data encryption (Projects B, C)
- Requirement R3: Performance optimization (All projects)

Analyze:
1. Implementation strategies that maximize code reuse
2. Potential conflicts or dependencies between requirements
3. Optimal execution order considering project priorities
4. Resource allocation recommendations
```

### 2. Progressive Analysis Depth

#### Level 1: Surface Analysis
- Quick health checks across all projects
- Basic metrics collection (LOC, complexity, test coverage)
- Immediate issue identification

#### Level 2: Detailed Analysis
- In-depth code quality analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance profiling
- Dependency analysis

#### Level 3: Deep Insights
- AI-powered code review and suggestions
- Architectural analysis and recommendations
- Predictive modeling for project outcomes
- Cross-project optimization opportunities

### 3. Adaptive Analysis Strategies

#### Project-Specific Strategies
```python
analysis_strategies = {
    "web_application": {
        "focus_areas": ["security", "performance", "accessibility"],
        "tools": ["lighthouse", "sonarqube", "owasp_zap"],
        "metrics": ["page_load_time", "security_score", "accessibility_score"]
    },
    "api_service": {
        "focus_areas": ["performance", "reliability", "documentation"],
        "tools": ["load_testing", "api_testing", "doc_generation"],
        "metrics": ["response_time", "uptime", "api_coverage"]
    },
    "data_pipeline": {
        "focus_areas": ["data_quality", "performance", "monitoring"],
        "tools": ["data_validation", "profiling", "monitoring"],
        "metrics": ["data_accuracy", "processing_time", "error_rate"]
    }
}
```

#### Dynamic Strategy Selection
- Analyze project characteristics to select optimal analysis strategy
- Adapt analysis depth based on project importance and available resources
- Learn from previous analysis results to improve future strategies

### 4. Collaborative Analysis Prompts

#### Team-Aware Analysis
```
Analyze projects considering team dynamics:
- Team A (Frontend): 5 developers, React expertise, high velocity
- Team B (Backend): 3 developers, Python expertise, quality-focused
- Team C (Data): 2 developers, ML expertise, research-oriented

Provide recommendations that:
1. Leverage each team's strengths
2. Identify collaboration opportunities
3. Suggest knowledge sharing initiatives
4. Optimize workload distribution
```

#### Cross-Team Coordination
```
Given the following cross-team dependencies:
- Frontend team needs API endpoints from Backend team
- Backend team needs data models from Data team
- All teams need shared authentication service

Analyze and recommend:
1. Optimal development sequence
2. Interface definitions and contracts
3. Testing strategies for integration points
4. Risk mitigation for dependency chains
```
