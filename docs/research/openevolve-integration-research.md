2. **LLM Ensemble**: Generates code modifications via multiple language models
3. **Evaluator Pool**: Tests generated programs and assigns multi-objective scores
4. **Program Database**: Stores programs and evaluation metrics, guiding future evolution
5. **Controller**: Orchestrates asynchronous interactions between components

#### Technical Capabilities:
- Evolution of entire code files, not just functions
- Multi-objective optimization support
- OpenAI-compatible API integration
- Distributed evaluation capabilities
- Checkpoint/resume functionality
- Flexible prompt engineering
