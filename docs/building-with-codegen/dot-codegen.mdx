The `.codegen` directory contains your project's Codegen configuration, codemods, and supporting files. It's automatically created when you run `gs init`.

## Directory Structure

```bash
.codegen/
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/            # Python virtual environment (gitignored)
â”œâ”€â”€ config.toml       # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ codemods/         # Your codemod implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ jupyter/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
â””â”€â”€ codegen-system-prompt.txt  # AI system prompt
```

## Initialization

The directory is created and managed using the `gs init` command:

```bash
gs init [--fetch-docs] [--repo-name NAME] [--organization-name ORG]
```

<Note>
The `--fetch-docs` flag downloads API documentation and examples specific to your project's programming language.
</Note>

## Virtual Environment

Codegen maintains its own virtual environment in `.codegen/.venv/` to ensure consistent package versions and isolation from your project's dependencies. This environment is:

- Created using `uv` for fast, reliable package management
- Initialized with Python 3.13
- Automatically managed by Codegen commands
- Used for running codemods and Jupyter notebooks
- Gitignored to avoid committing environment-specific files

The environment is created during `gs init` and used by commands like `gs run` and `gs notebook`.

<Note>To debug codemods, you will need to set the python virtual environment in your IDE to `.codegen/.venv`</Note>

### Configuration

The `.env` file stores your project settings:

```env
REPOSITORY_OWNER = "your-org"
REPOSITORY_PATH = "/root/git/your-repo"
REPOSITORY_LANGUAGE = "python"  # or other supported language
```

This configuration is used by Codegen to provide language-specific features and proper repository context.

## Git Integration

Codegen automatically adds appropriate entries to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Codegen
.codegen/.venv/
.codegen/docs/
.codegen/jupyter/
.codegen/codegen-system-prompt.txt
```

<Info>
- While most directories are ignored, your codemods in `.codegen/codemods/` and `config.toml` are tracked in Git
- The virtual environment and Jupyter notebooks are gitignored to avoid environment-specific issues
</Info>

## Working with Codemods

The `codemods/` directory is where your transformation functions live. You can create new codemods using:

```bash
gs create my-codemod PATH [--description "what it does"]
```

This will:
1. Create a new file in `.codegen/codemods/`
2. Generate a system prompt in `.codegen/prompts/` (if using `--description`)
3. Set up the necessary imports and decorators

<Tip>
Use `gs list` to see all codemods in your project.
</Tip>

## Jupyter Integration

The `jupyter/` directory contains notebooks for interactive development:

```python
from graph_sitter import Codebase

# Initialize codebase
codebase = Codebase('../../')

# Print stats
print(f"ðŸ“š Total Files: {len(codebase.files)}")
print(f"âš¡ Total Functions: {len(codebase.functions)}")
```

<Note>
A default notebook is created during initialization to help you explore your codebase.
</Note>

## Next Steps

After initializing your `.codegen` directory:

1. Create your first codemod:
```bash
gs create my-codemod . -d "describe what you want to do"
```

2. Run it:
```bash
gs run my-codemod --apply-local
```

3. Deploy it for team use:
```bash
codegen deploy my-codemod
```
