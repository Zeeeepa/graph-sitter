Connect Codegen to your Slack workspace to enable seamless communication between agents and your team.

## Capabilities

The Slack integration allows agents to interact within your designated channels:

- **Send Messages:** Post updates, ask questions, report results, and notify team members.
- **Read Messages:** (Optional) Agents can be configured to read messages in specific channels to gather context or respond to requests (requires careful permission setup).
- **User Mentions:** Tag specific users or groups for notifications.

## How Agents Use Slack

Agents use Slack primarily for communication and notifications:

- **Progress Updates:** Informing a channel or user when a task starts, encounters an issue, or is completed.
- **Requesting Feedback:** Asking for clarification or input on a specific implementation detail or ambiguity.
- **Sharing Results:** Posting links to created PRs, summaries of changes, or errors encountered.
- **Notifications:** Alerting the team about build failures, successful deployments, or critical issues identified.

## Installation

Add the Codegen Slack App to your workspace to enable agent communication.
