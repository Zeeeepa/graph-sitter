🏛️ ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
1. 🔥 IMMEDIATE (Critical Priority):
   • Fix missing function definitions (217 errors)
   • Resolve high-complexity functions (503 functions)
   • Address circular dependencies

2. ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY:
   • Refactor large classes (>20 methods)
   • Optimize performance bottlenecks
   • Add missing error handling

3. 👉 MEDIUM PRIORITY:
   • Improve documentation coverage
   • Reduce function parameter counts
   • Consolidate similar components

4. 🔍 LOW PRIORITY:
   • Clean up unused imports
   • Standardize naming conventions
   • Add type annotations

🎯 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
------------------------------
Phase 1 - Critical Fixes (Week 1-2):
  • Define missing functions identified by error_analysis.py
  • Break down highest complexity functions (>30 complexity)
  • Fix circular dependencies

Phase 2 - Architecture Improvements (Week 3-4):
  • Refactor large classes using Single Responsibility Principle
  • Implement proper error handling patterns
  • Optimize identified performance bottlenecks

Phase 3 - Quality Enhancements (Week 5-6):
  • Add comprehensive documentation
  • Implement consistent coding standards
  • Add missing unit tests

✅ PR INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT
-----------------------------------
