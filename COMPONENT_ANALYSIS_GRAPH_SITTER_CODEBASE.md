   - Modular design supporting extensibility
   - Language-agnostic approach with specific implementations

2. **Transaction-Based Safety**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues & Optimization Opportunities:

#### 1. **Performance Concerns**
```python
# Found in transaction_manager.py line 35
# TODO: consider using SortedList for better performance
queued_transactions: dict[Path, list[Transaction]]
```

**Impact**: Current unsorted list implementation may cause performance degradation with large transaction volumes.

**Recommendation**: Implement SortedList or similar optimized data structure.

#### 2. **Incomplete Error Handling**
```python
# Found in flagging/groupers/codeowner_grouper.py
flag_owners = repo_operator.codeowners_parser.of(flag.filepath)  # TODO: handle codeowners_parser could be null
```

**Impact**: Potential null pointer exceptions in codeowner parsing.

**Recommendation**: Add null checks and fallback mechanisms.

#### 3. **Unimplemented Features**
```python
# Found in flagging/groupers/codeowner_grouper.py
msg = "TODO: implement single group creation"
raise NotImplementedError(msg)
```

**Impact**: Missing functionality in grouping system.

**Recommendation**: Implement missing group creation methods.

#### 4. **AST Parsing Accuracy Issues**
```python
# Found in node_classes/ts_node_classes.py
"type_identifier": Name,  # HACK
"intersection_type": TSUnionType,  # TODO: Not accurate, implement this properly
```

**Impact**: Inaccurate TypeScript AST parsing for complex types.

**Recommendation**: Implement proper intersection type handling.

#### 5. **Context Management Complexity**
```python
# Found in codebase_context.py
# TODO: this is wrong with context changes
# TODO: Fix this to be more robust with multiple projects
```

**Impact**: Potential issues with multi-project contexts and context changes.

**Recommendation**: Refactor context management for better robustness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Fixes & Optimizations

### High Priority (Critical for CI/CD reliability):

1. **Transaction Performance Optimization**
   ```python
   # Replace in transaction_manager.py
   from sortedcontainers import SortedList
   
   class TransactionManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self.queued_transactions = defaultdict(SortedList)
   ```

2. **Null Safety in Codeowner Parsing**
   ```python
   # Add to codeowner_grouper.py
   def get_flag_owners(self, flag):
       if not self.repo_operator.codeowners_parser:
           return []
       return self.repo_operator.codeowners_parser.of(flag.filepath)
   ```

3. **Complete AST Type Handling**
   ```python
   # Implement proper intersection types in ts_node_classes.py
   class TSIntersectionType(TSUnionType):
       def __init__(self, node, file_node_id, ctx, parent):
           super().__init__(node, file_node_id, ctx, parent)
           self.intersection_types = self._parse_intersection_types()
