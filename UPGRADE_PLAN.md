3. **`codebase_context.py` (179 complexity)** - Modularize:
   - `context_builder.py` - Context construction
   - `context_cache.py` - Caching mechanisms
   - `context_serialization.py` - Serialization logic

#### Large File Decomposition
1. **`system_prompt.py` (9,911 lines)** - Split by functionality:
   - `prompts/` directory with categorized prompt files
   - `prompt_loader.py` - Dynamic prompt loading
   - `prompt_templates.py` - Template management

2. **`codebase.py` (1,613 lines)** - Extract modules:
   - `codebase_core.py` - Core functionality
   - `codebase_analysis.py` - Analysis methods
   - `codebase_manipulation.py` - Modification operations

### 3. Performance Optimizations (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### Memory Management
- **Lazy loading** for large codebases
- **Caching strategies** for frequently accessed symbols
- **Memory pooling** for AST nodes
- **Garbage collection optimization** for long-running processes

#### Algorithm Improvements
- **Parallel processing** for independent operations
- **Incremental parsing** for large files
- **Optimized graph algorithms** using rustworkx features
- **Batch operations** for multiple file modifications

#### Caching Enhancements
```python
# Enhanced caching strategy
@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def get_symbol_dependencies(symbol_id: str) -> List[Symbol]:
    """Cached dependency resolution with TTL."""
    pass

# Persistent cache for expensive operations
class PersistentSymbolCache:
    """Disk-based cache for symbol analysis results."""
    pass
```

### 4. Architecture Improvements (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### Plugin System Enhancement
```python
# Extensible plugin architecture
class LanguagePlugin(Protocol):
    """Protocol for language-specific plugins."""
    
    def parse_file(self, content: str) -> AST: ...
    def extract_symbols(self, ast: AST) -> List[Symbol]: ...
    def generate_code(self, symbols: List[Symbol]) -> str: ...
```

#### Event System Implementation
```python
# Event-driven architecture for better extensibility
class CodebaseEvent:
    """Base class for codebase events."""
    pass

class SymbolModifiedEvent(CodebaseEvent):
    """Emitted when a symbol is modified."""
    pass

class EventBus:
    """Central event bus for codebase operations."""
    pass
```

#### API Consistency Improvements
- **Standardize return types** across similar methods
- **Consistent error handling** with custom exception hierarchy
- **Unified configuration system** for all components
- **Better type annotations** for improved IDE support

### 5. Developer Experience (Priority: MEDIUM)

#### Enhanced CLI Tools
```bash
# New CLI commands for better developer experience
gs analyze --complexity --output=json
gs refactor --target=high-complexity --dry-run
gs optimize --memory --parallel
gs validate --check-todos --check-types
```

#### Improved Documentation

- **Migration guides** for API changes
- **Best practices guide** for large codebases

#### Better Error Messages
```python
# Enhanced error reporting
class GraphSitterError(Exception):
    """Base exception with context and suggestions."""
    
    def __init__(self, message: str, context: Dict, suggestions: List[str]):
        self.context = context
        self.suggestions = suggestions
        super().__init__(self._format_message(message))
```

### 6. Testing & Quality Assurance (Priority: HIGH)

#### Test Coverage Improvements
- **Increase coverage** from current to >95%
- **Performance regression tests** for critical paths
