# Graph-Sitter: AI-Powered Code Analysis & Orchestration Platform

[Graph-sitter](https://graph-sitter.com) is a comprehensive Python framework that combines powerful code analysis, AI agent orchestration, and seamless integrations to transform how you work with codebases.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Graph-sitter consists of three core modules working in harmony:

### 1. üß† **Codegen SDK** - AI Agent Integration
Direct programmatic access to Codegen's AI Software Engineers via API.

```python
from codegen import Agent

# Initialize the Agent with your organization ID and API token
agent = Agent(
    org_id="11",  # Your organization ID
    token="your_api_token_here",  # Your API authentication token
    base_url="https://codegen-sh-rest-api.modal.run",  # Optional - defaults to this URL
)

# Run an agent with a prompt
task = agent.run(prompt="Which github repos can you currently access?")

# Check the initial status
print(task.status)  # Returns the current status of the task

# Refresh the task to get updated status
task.refresh()

# Once task is complete, you can access the result
if task.status == "completed":
    print(task.result)
```

### 2. üéØ **Contexten** - Agentic Orchestrator
Advanced chat agents with LangChain integration and multi-platform support (GitHub, Linear, Slack).

```python
from contexten import ContextenAgent

# Initialize contexten agent with integrations
agent = ContextenAgent(
    anthropic_api_key="your_key",
    github_token="your_token",
    linear_api_key="your_key"
)

# Run orchestrated workflows
result = await agent.execute_workflow(
    "Create a Linear issue for the bug found in PR #123 and assign it to the team"
)
```

### 3. üîç **Graph-Sitter** - Code Analysis Engine
Powerful code manipulation and analysis using Tree-sitter parsing with graph algorithms.

```python
from graph_sitter import Codebase

# Graph-sitter builds a complete graph connecting
# functions, classes, imports and their relationships
codebase = Codebase("./")

# Work with code without dealing with syntax trees or parsing
for function in codebase.functions:
    # Comprehensive static analysis for references, dependencies, etc.
    if not function.usages:
        # Auto-handles references and imports to maintain correctness
        function.move_to_file("deprecated.py")
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install inside existing project
uv pip install graph-sitter

# Install global CLI
uv tool install graph-sitter --python 3.13

# Create a codemod for a given repo
cd path/to/repo
gs init
gs create test-function

# Run the codemod
gs run test-function

# Create an isolated venv with codegen => open jupyter
gs notebook
```

### Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your integrations:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
```

Key environment variables:
- `CODEGEN_ORG_ID` & `CODEGEN_TOKEN` - For Codegen SDK
- `CONTEXTEN_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For AI agent capabilities  
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - For GitHub integration
- `LINEAR_API_KEY` - For Linear integration
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - For Slack integration

## üìö Core Features

- **Extensible Architecture**: Build custom integrations and workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests (recommended for development)
./scripts/run_tests.sh --unit

# Run integration tests
./scripts/run_tests.sh --integration

# Run all tests
./scripts/run_tests.sh --all

# Run with coverage
./scripts/run_tests.sh --coverage
```

### Building from Source

```bash
# Full development setup
./scripts/fullbuild.sh

# Quick build and test
./scripts/build_and_test.sh --test
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

Our comprehensive CI/CD pipeline includes:
- **Multi-platform testing** (Ubuntu, macOS, ARM)
- **Parallel test execution** for faster feedback
- **Automated releases** to PyPI
- **Code quality checks** (MyPy, pre-commit hooks)

See [CICD_FLOW.md](CICD_FLOW.md) for detailed documentation.

## üåü Use Cases

## üéØ Why Graph-sitter?

Software development is fundamentally programmatic. Graph-sitter provides the tools to express complex code transformations, analysis, and automation as programs themselves.

**Built for the AI Era**: As AI becomes central to development workflows, Graph-sitter provides the programmatic interface that both humans and AI need to manipulate code effectively.

**Enterprise-Tested**: Battle-tested on codebases with millions of lines of code across Python, TypeScript, and React.

**Developer-Focused**: APIs that match how developers think about code changes - "move this function", "rename this variable", "add this parameter" - without wrestling with ASTs or manual import management.
